## 🔹 1. **Prerequisites**

Before starting, make sure you have the following components installed:

✅ **Google Chrome** (latest version)  
✅ **Python 3.10.0** (recommended to use `pyenv-win`)  
✅ **PowerShell** (recommended to run in Administrator mode)  
✅ **pip and virtualenv** (to manage dependencies)  
✅ **Git** (optional, but recommended for cloning the repository)  

To install `pyenv-win` (if you don’t have it yet):
```powershell
Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://pyenv-win.github.io/pyenv-win/install.ps1')
```

To verify the installation of `pyenv-win`, run:
```powershell
pyenv --version
```

---

## 🔹 2. **Clone the Repository** (Optional)
If you want to clone the project from a GitHub repository:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/searchmeajobBot.git
cd searchmeajobBot
```

---

## 🔹 3. **Run the Setup Script**

To set up the environment and download all necessary dependencies, run the following command in PowerShell:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
Then, start the setup with:
```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```
This script:
- Detects the installed version of Google Chrome and downloads the corresponding `ChromeDriver`.
- Configures Python using `pyenv-win` and creates a virtual environment (`venv`).
- Installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Verifies the installation of Selenium in PowerShell.

If you encounter errors with `pip`, try updating it manually:
```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

---

## 🔹 4. **Configure Chrome Profile**
The bot requires a specific Chrome profile to avoid additional verifications. Make sure to configure the following options in `main.py`:

```python
options.add_argument(r"user-data-dir=C:\Users\your_username\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data")
options.add_argument("--profile-directory=Profile 1")
```

If you don’t have a configured profile, open Chrome and create a new profile. Then, update the `profile-directory` in `main.py` with the correct profile name.

To check which profiles you have in Chrome:
1. Open Chrome.
2. Type `chrome://version/` in the address bar.
3. Look for `Profile in use` and copy the directory name.

---

## 🔹 5. **Activate the Virtual Environment**
If the virtual environment was not activated automatically, you can do it manually:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
To confirm that the environment is active:
```powershell
python --version
```
It should display something like: `Python 3.10.0 (venv)`.

---

## 🔹 6. **Run the LinkedIn Bot**
Once the environment is set up, run the bot with:
```powershell
python main.py
```
⚠️ **Note:** If the bot requires LinkedIn credentials, make sure to store them using `keyring` before running the script:
```powershell
python -c "import keyring; keyring.set_password('linkedin', 'email', 'your-email')"
python -c "import keyring; keyring.set_password('linkedin', 'password', 'your-password')"
```

---

## 🔹 7. **Troubleshooting**
If the bot does not work correctly, check the following points:

### 🔸 7.1 Error with `pywin32` or `win32gui`
If you encounter errors when importing `win32gui`, install `pywin32` manually:
```powershell
pip install --no-cache-dir pywin32
python -m pywin32_postinstall
```

### 🔸 7.2 Incompatible ChromeDriver
If ChromeDriver does not match your Chrome version, try deleting and rerunning `setup.ps1`:
```powershell
Remove-Item chromedriver.exe
.\setup.ps1
```

### 🔸 7.3 LinkedIn Requires Additional Verification
If LinkedIn requests a verification code, the bot will not be able to proceed automatically. In this case:
1. Open Chrome manually.
2. Log into LinkedIn with the same user.
3. Ensure there are no account blocks.

---

## 📌 **Conclusion**
Following these steps, you should have the LinkedIn bot properly set up and running. 🚀

If you have more questions, check the logs generated by the script to identify possible errors.

Good luck automating your job applications! 💼🤖
